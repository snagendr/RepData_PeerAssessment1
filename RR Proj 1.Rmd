This is an R Markdown document for the Reproducable Research project #1.

Loading and preprocessing the data:

Show any code that is needed to

   * Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

   * Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for analysis


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
setwd("C:/Users/Shekhar/Documents/Johns Hopkins/Data")
df1 <- read.csv("activity.csv")
df1 <- tbl_df(df1) # store original data in a better dplyr format
df2 <- na.omit(df1)# remove NA values and store in df2

df2_by_day <- group_by(df2,date)
df3 <- summarize(df2_by_day,sum(steps))
names(df3) <- c("date","steps")
```
### Total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
kable(df3)
```

### Histogram of Total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
hist(df3$steps)
```


`r print("")`
```{r}
steps_mean <- as.integer(round(mean(df3$steps),digits=0))
steps_median <- median(df3$steps)
```

Mean of total number of steps per day is `r steps_mean`
Median of total number of steps per day is `r steps_median`

  
### Average Daily Activity Pattern
```{r}
df2_by_interval <- group_by(df2,interval)
df4 <- summarize(df2_by_interval,mean(steps))
names(df4) <- c("interval","mean_steps")
with(df4,plot(interval,mean_steps,type="l"))
```

### Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps
```{r}
i <- which.max(df4$mean_steps)
max_steps <- round(max(df4$mean_steps),digits=2)
interval_max_steps <- df4$interval[i]
```
#### The maximum number of steps is `r max_steps`, and the interval that contains this max value is `r interval_max_steps`

### Imputing Missing Values
```{r}
original_rows <- nrow(df1)
na_rows <- nrow(df1) - nrow(df2)
```
#### There are `r original_rows` rows in the original Excel data file, of which `r na_rows` rows have missing (NA) values 

### Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy uses the mean for that 5-minute interval.

Create a new dataset (df6) that is equal to the original dataset (df1) but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
ix <- is.na(df1$steps)
df5 <- left_join(df1,df4,by="interval")
head(df5)
df5$steps[ix] <- df5$mean_steps[ix]
head(df5)
df6 <- df5[,1:3]
head(df6)
```

### Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
hist(df1$steps)
```

`r print("")`
```{r}
steps_mean <- as.integer(round(mean(df6$steps),digits=0))
steps_median <- median(df6$steps)
```

#### Mean of total number of steps per day with this data is `r steps_mean`
#### Median of total number of steps per day is `r steps_median`

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

#### Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r}
df6 <- within(df6, {
       f_wday <- as.factor(ifelse(as.POSIXlt(date)$wday %in% c(6,7),"weekend","weekday"))
})
str(df6)
```

### Make a panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)

```{r}
d1 <- df6
d1_by_wday_interval <- group_by(d1,f_wday,interval)
d2 <- summarize(d1_by_wday_interval,mean(steps))
names(d2) <- c("f_wday","interval","mean_steps")
head(d2)
g <- ggplot(d2, aes(interval,mean_steps))
g <- g + geom_line() + facet_grid(f_wday ~ .)
print(g)
```
